THANKS!:

Some kind words from satisfied Reva users:

... I am very pleased you made this available. I compiled in some code to do
conversions of encoded information in a DB.  I could have used Perl, or even
awk for this. Now I start Reva, and have several conversion tools right
away. This makes me analyze trace files faster in just a small environment.
Thanks a bunch !

... I am ever more impressed with Reva. It's simple, fast, tiny and
powerful, and makes tiny applications. After getting so accustomed to the
bloat and complexity of other development systems, Reva is a breath of fresh
air. Well done!

... I am glad to have found Reva and am enjoying using it. I plan to carry a CD
with the EXE and some tools when going offsite rather than lugging a laptop with
Visual Basic. I am a happy camper,

... small new forth for Windows and Linux (derived from Retro Forth) with examples of
graphic applications on both platforms. It is written in assembler.
Nonstandard, but interesting :)


... I recently tried Reva, An independent development of Forth.  It is very nice
and comes with some "newbie" to Forth documentation-- Which helps people like
me.  It's a good way to find out if you like Forth or just want to try it.  It's
a work in progress


... I think reva is fantastic ! Thanks a lot indeed.
