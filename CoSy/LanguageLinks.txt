  At Stanford . I was there and know\/knew almost all those guys but I 
  don't remember the panel . What I really remember is Stanley Jordan ,
   https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stanley+jordan , who learned 
  APL at Princton , asking us for APL expressions which would map into MIDI
  values which he would then try to strum -- then checked against the expression
  executed on a MIDI connected computer .

 “I like the observation that Forth is an amplifier: a good programmer
 can write a great program; a bad programmer a terrible one. 
 I feel no need to cater to bad programmers.”
  Charles H. Moore

20170102.1624 | Given that I learned APL in the first place ,
 AI algorithms like this which are making news :
  Google’s Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation 
   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04558v1.pdf
 are a motivation for my constructing CoSy .


 There is a whole series of great lectures by great mathematician & Turing winner
 Richard Hamming , creator of error correcting codes on :
  https://www.youtube.com/user/securitylectures 
 These are the sorts of resources which make traditional education too inefficient
 for talented motivated students today .
Hamming, "Error-Correcting Codes" (April 21, 1995) 
 https://youtu.be/BZh07Ew32UA?t=37m55s
 " I'll be outrageous again .
  Pythagoras was the first great physicist . He found we live in L2 .
   That the sum of the squares of the sides give you the square of the diagonal
    of a rectangle .
  Hamming in some vague sense is Pythagoras Jr. He says 
   Yes Pythagoras is right about the physical world . 
   NO about the mental world .  The difference between 2 strings of bits is
   the sum of the differences . It is NOT the sum of the squares . "
