CREDITS:

Reva is not a one-man project, even though I do write most of the code and make
the releases.  It is proper to show gratitude for the many who came before me
and those who help me along.  My deepest gratitude and sincere thanks to:

 - The Win32Forth team, particularly Alex McDonald - for "cutting my teeth" in
   Forth and providing a useful platform.  They are also to be commended for
   giving me the impetus to strike out on my own path.
 - The folks on "comp.lang.forth" for providing much food for thought and
   (on occasion) answers.
 - Elizabeth Rather et. al. for publishing excellent reference material.
   Likewise Leo Brodie.
 - Charles Moore for having started the Forth ball rolling so many years ago.
 - Tomasz Grysztar for creating the superb FASM assembler, without which Reva
   would be unlikely.
 - Most of all, the RetroForth team - especially Charles Childers, for his
   generous spirit and wonderful technical insights.  Reva truly would not have
   happened without his support.  Also (in no particular order) William Cook,
   Helmar Wodtke, Danny Reinhold and many others.  You guys are an incredible
   support team, and I really appreciate your help and input.
