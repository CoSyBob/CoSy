			     Reva 7.0 - 23 Sep 2007
                        by Ron Aaron (ron@ronware.org)

This document is intended as a "first step" to get you up and running Reva.
The complete documentation is on the Wiki: 

	http://ronware.org/reva/wiki/ 
	
That is where you should look for in-depth information (including installation
information).  It is kept up-to-date.

Reva has a pretty good online help system.  Just type "help".  For help on a
specific word, specify that word after "help" -- for example, "help @"

Should you find Reva useful, please send me an email and/or consider joining the
Reva discussion board at http://ronware.org/reva/ .  If you like, you can donate
to the cause: http://ronware.org/reva/wiki/Donations

Enjoy!
